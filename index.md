features:
  - title: Distributed System
    details: The idea of dividing tasks is exciting for me. The way a distributed system becomes resillent over time attracts me to it.   
  - title: Visualizations
    details: Visualizations are incredibly powerful tools that are often underestimated. They have the ability to convey complex information in a simple and impactful manner. A well-crafted visualization can communicate a message more effectively than pages of text. Conversely, a poorly executed visualization can fail to convey any meaningful information, leading to confusion or misinterpretation.
